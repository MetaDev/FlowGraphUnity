# FlowGraphUnity
A push-based flow graph for generating modular environments in Unity3D using Reactive Extensions.

This repository contains the prototype of my first thesis topic (development branch). I changed my topic after a month and thus abandoned this one. Maybe I pick it up at some point, because I think the idea is definitely worth pursuing but a little to ambitious at the time.

See "development" branch for latest version.
