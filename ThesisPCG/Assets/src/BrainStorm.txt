		TODO implement similarly to Parameter (hidden generics) also TupelParameter and 2DParameter
		and sourceNode as well


		step by step introduce generics that bubble from ISubject to Iparameter to ISourceNode 

		generics would be possible if working with Tuples instead of dictionaries
		This would result in a fixed amount of parameters at compile time, which isn't neccesarly a problem


		ITarget<T>
		ISource<T>

		T->Tuple<T1,T2,T3,...>
